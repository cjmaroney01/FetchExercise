## Fetch programming exercise for Colin Maroney 3/19/25

### build instructions

There are no special build instructions. The app should be importable and run normally.   
It has been tested on an Android 15 emulator.

### notes from the developer

Sorry this took a couple of days! I was unable to work on it the day I got   
the invitation, and as I am working my regular job I can only work on it in   
the evenings.  Also, I wrote a bunch of tests to show off my unit testing   
prowess (I like to write units), and also because tests are important,  
so please check out my tests!
